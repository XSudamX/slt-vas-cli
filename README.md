# Python CLI Program for SLT VAS

Created for Personal use, initially because VAS doesnt show night-time data seperately. 

# Keyword Finder

Use this branch to get a one big dict of the total usages on each day of the month. Then plug it into a [Dict Beautifier](https://codebeautify.org/python-formatter-beautifier).
You can then manually look through it and pick some keywords and plug it in the keywords array of the total usage detector function
Currently I dont see a way to automate this thanks to how vague the current output from SLT report is, it shows like 3 different names for the same thing and adds network protocols etc..
